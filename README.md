# MoneyBaggYooo

MoneyBaggYooo is a simple GUI application that helps users track their finances and product inventory. The application is written in Python using the tkinter library and allows users to credit or repay clients, manage cash on hand, and track product inventory.

## Features

MoneyBaggYooo has three main frames: Client Info, Finances, and Product Info.

### Client Info Frame

The Client Info frame allows users to select a client from a dropdown list and credit or repay the client's account with a specific amount. Users can also add a new client and credit their account with a specific amount.
